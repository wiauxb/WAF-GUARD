## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Node Details
Each node type has specific attributes.

[comment]: # (Maybe here we can give these attributes by categories; the main attributes that are common to every node types in a category.)

### Example : `SecRule` Node
Represents a reference to a SecRule call
```json
{
  "property": "String",
  "type": "String"
}
```

### Example : `Regex` Node
Not really a node but more of a choice of construction...
```json
{
  "property": "String",
  "type": "List"
}
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Relationships
Relationships between nodes define interactions.

| Relationship  | From Node | To Node | Description |
|--------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AtLocation`  | secdebuglog     | Location | This secdebuglog call was made at this location. |
| `InVirtualHost`   | secdebuglog     | VirtualHost  | This  secdebuglog call is in this virtual host.|
| `Uses` | secdebuglog    | Constant| This secdebulog uses this constant. |

[comment]: # (If relationships contain attributes, mention them as well. Didn't see any relations with attributes in this graph but maybe I missed it.)
